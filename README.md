# csv_plot_maker
The program is designed to generate csv files or graphs for pcap files. It facilitates the preparation of datasets for training spiking neural networks. By default, it plots graphs for a pcap file lasting 60 seconds with a break of 15 seconds. A graph of the dependence of the size of input packets on the delay of packet arrival is also plotted.
